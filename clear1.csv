I see a bad moon rising
Love is a battlefield.
You can go your own way.
Baby we were born to run.
Rock you like a hurricane
Shine on you crazy diamond
I hear that train a coming.
It's been a hard day's night
Another one bites the dust.
Take a walk on the wild side.
We don't need no education.
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
